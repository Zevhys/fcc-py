Completed five hands-on projects from FreeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing with Python course. This shows my skills in working with numbers, making data visuals, and solving scientific problems using Python tools

## Table of Contents
These projects are designed to test and let you apply the Python concepts you've learned throughout the course, such as:
- [Arithmetic Formatter](project/1-arithmetic-formatter/arithmetic.py) 🔢: </br>
This project involves arranging simple arithmetic problems vertically, just like you'd see them written out for manual calculation.

- [Time Calculator](project/2-arithmetic formatter/time.py) ⏰: </br>
Here, you'll create a function to calculate a future time after a certain duration has been added to a starting time.

- [Budget App](project/3-arithmetic-formatter/budget.py) 📊: </br>
This project requires you to build a simple application to manage a personal budget using different spending categories.

- [Polygon Area Calculator](project/4-arithmetic-formatter/polygon.py) 📐: </br>
You will create classes to represent shapes like rectangles and squares, and calculate their properties (e.g., area, perimeter).

- [Probability Calculator](project/5-arithmetic-formatter/probability.py) 🎲: </br>
This project involves writing code to simulate probability experiments and estimate outcomes.

# Requirements

<pre>
## Installation & Setup
#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
1. Install Python 3 and set it as default:
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install python-is-python3

#### Windows
1. Visit https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
2. Download the latest Python 3 installer
3. Run the installer and check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
4. Verify installation by opening Command Prompt and typing:
   python --version

#### macOS
1. Install Homebrew (if not already installed):
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
2. Install Python 3:
   brew install python
3. Create an alias to use 'python' command for Python 3:
   echo "alias python=python3" >> ~/.zshrc
4. Reload your shell configuration:
   source ~/.zshrc
5. Verify installation:
   python --version
